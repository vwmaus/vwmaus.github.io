- My research team has been exploring this rich open satellite data archives to map mines

- As currently there are no automated algorithms that can map mines globally

- We have mapped small-scale and industrial mines via visual interpretation of satellite images

- Automated global scale mapping mines is an open scientific challenge

- As a result we constructed a database including about 45,000 polygons covering about 100,000 km² of mines globally

- In this map you can see the spatial distribution of the polygons

- This database untapped a range of global land use and ecological assessments

- The polygons are distributed across 145 countries

- And the area is unevenly distributed, 6 countries account for more than 50% of the mapped mining area

- This includes, Russia, China, Australia, United States, Indonesia, and Brazil

- It is important to note that, the database covers LSM and SAM globally

- As we can see the mining areas in red in this slide are within protected areas, outside the consecrations in orange

- Although, we have not check this areas with Brazilian authorities, they are likely illegal activities

- My team is currently conducting a more comprehensive study to check how much mining is outside concession

- But this is still challenging for several countries as we do not always have open information about concessions

- Our database has also served as bassis for other studies, for example

- Based on this database, we have published last week a new study together with WWF Germany

- Where we have quantified the mining related deforestation globally

- Some main highlights of this study are shown in this map

- Showing the countries contribution to mining related deforestation from 2001 to 2019

- In this study we have also linked deforestation to individual commodities

???

- Sentinel-2 images provide sufficient spatial and temporal resolution for near real time monitoring, but supporting information with higher spatial resolution is critical

- Current automated approaches work well for homogeneous regions and mining types but not for large scales applications

- Cloud cover in tropical regions can substantially delay the detection

- Local expert knowledge is critical

- Open Earth observation images (Sentinel-2) provide sufficient spatial and temporal resolution for near real time monitoring

- However, higher spatial resolution is very useful, e.g. openly available for the tropics from Norway's International Climate and Forests Initiative Satellite Data Program

- How can we transition from snapshots of mining land use to monitoring mining activities over time?

- Our global mining database was very useful to calculate some ecological footprints 

- However, can only provide snapshots of land use, as it is very time-consuming

- Monitoring mining activities requires automation
